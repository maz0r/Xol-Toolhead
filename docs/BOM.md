# Xol Toolhead Bill of Materials (BOM)
Read **ALL** of the sections below to understand your hardware requirements, there's some bits here that aren't on a standard Voron build BOM.
The chances are that something was missed, but if you have a good mix of M2, M2.5 and M3 hardware you'll probably still end up with a working printer.

## Carriage

#### Required Hardware
| Qty | Item | Notes|
|-----|------|------|
|5 | M3 Heatset Insert| Standard Voron spec: 5mm Outer Diameter x 4mm Length|
|6* | M3 x 6 BHCS | `Only 2 required if using MGN9H carriage`<br/>4x MGN12H carriage mounting<br/>2x probe module|
|8* | M3 x 8 SHCS | `only 4 required if using MGN12H carriage`<br/>4x Join carriage front to carriage rear<br/>4x MGN9H carriage mounting |
| 4 | M3 Hex Nut | |
| 2* | M3 x 25 Pin | Belt mounting system for 6mm belts | 
| 2* | M3 x 30 Pin | Belt mounting system for 9mm belts |

#### Optional Hardware
| Qty | Item | Notes|
|-----|------|------|
|2 | M3 Heatset Insert| If not using m2.5 heatsets for toolhead feet attachment|

#### Probe Hardware
Follow probe instructions for required hardware. Where possible, self tapping screws have been replaced with heatset hardware, usually M2.

`* If using Voron Design TAP RC8+ it is recommended to replace the two M3 x 50 SHCS with M3 x 50 BHCS to improve build plate clearance.`
