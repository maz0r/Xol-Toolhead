`*Sherpa-Mini CNC has been measured as 2mm shorter, but there may be variations by manufacturer`<br/>
`**DFA measurements are to the top of the chamfer inside the extruder bottom. You will need to chamfer the top of the PTFE tube or shorten by 1mm`<br/>
`***All of these measurements are based off CAD. It is always best to measure and cut to length based on your own setup`
