### Xol Carriage
A new carriage built to allow Xol to standardise around the Voron CW2 (TAP) mounting pattern.

#### Carriage Design Goals
* Uses same mounting pattern as TAP (reduce Xol permutations)
* Easily remove toolhead from carriage without toolhead disassembly
* Modular approach to probes

#### Additional Hardware
To accommodate design requirements, some additional hardware will be required when using this mount.
Specifically:
* M2.5 heatsets are used in the feet of the Xol hotend mount
* M3 x 25mm pins (30mm for 9mm belt version) are used in the belt attachment system

The dimensions of the M2.5 heatsets are
* thread: M2.5
* Length: 4mm
* Outer Diameter: 3.5mm
(M2.5x4x3.5)

Thanks to the Armchair Engineering team and Voron Design. This carriage is built for Xol but is based heavily on the Voron Design CW2 mounting system.
